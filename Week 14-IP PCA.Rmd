## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Reading the data

```{r}
df =read.csv("http://bit.ly/CarreFourDataset")
head(df)
```
##Data Cleaning

```{r}
# Checking null values
colSums(is.na(df))
#There is no null values in our dataset
```

```{r}
sum(duplicated(df))
#there are no duplicates in our data
```


## PCA

```{r}
numcols= df[c(6:8,12,14:16)]
head(numcols)
```
```{r}
# Apply PCA using prcomp function
#The prcomp function takes in the data as input, and it is highly recommended to set the argument scale=TRUE. This standardize the input data so that it has zero mean and variance one before doing PCA
# Need to scale / Normalize as
# PCA depends on distance measure
my_pca <- prcomp(numcols, scale = TRUE,
                center = TRUE, retx = T)
names(my_pca)
#it has 5 variables
```

```{r}
pc=princomp(numcols, cor = TRUE)
names(pc)
```

```{r}
# bar plot
plot(pc)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
```

```{r}
library(devtools)
```

```{r}
library(ggbiplot)
```

```{r}
ggbiplot(my_pca)
#From the graph we will see that the variables unit price, gross income and quantity contribute mostle to pc2 whereas rating contributes to pc 1
#Adding more detail to the plot, we provide arguments rownames as labels.
```

```{r}
ggbiplot(my_pca, labels=rownames(numcols), obs.scale = 1, var.scale = 1)
```

##Conclusion

1. Pc1 contributes to majority of the variance in our data whereas Pc2 and Pc3 are almost equal.

2. The variables unit price, gross income and quantity contribute mostle to pc2 whereas rating contributes to pc 1
