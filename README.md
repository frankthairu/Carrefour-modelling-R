# Week-14-IP

# Project Description
We are a Data analyst company at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). Your project has been divided into four parts where you'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on our insights.

We will be performing the following unsupervised methods:

* Dimensionality Reduction

This section of the project entails reducing the dataset to a low dimensional dataset using PCA. 

* Feature Selection

This section requires us to perform feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods.

* Association Rules

This section will require that we create association rules that will allow you to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. We are provided with a separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others. 

* Anomaly Detection

We have also been requested to check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset. The objective of this task being fraud detection.
