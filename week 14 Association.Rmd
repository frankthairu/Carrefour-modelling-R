## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(arules)
path_trans<-"http://bit.ly/SupermarketDatasetII"
df<-read.transactions(path_trans,sep=',')
df
```

```{r}
# Verifying the object's class
# ---
# This should show us transactions as the type of data that we will need
# ---
# 
class(df)
```

```{r}
# Previewing our first 5 transactions
#
inspect(df[1:5])
```

```{r}
# This would give us some information such as the most purchased items, 
# distribution of the item sets (no. of items purchased in each transaction), etc.
# ---
# 
summary(df)
```
```{r}
# Exploring the frequency of some articles 
# i.e. transacations ranging from 1 to 10 and performing 
# some operation in percentage terms of the total transactions 
itemFrequency(df[, 1:10],type = "absolute")
round(itemFrequency(df[, 1:10],type = "relative")*100,2)
```

```{r}
# Producing a chart of frequencies and fitering 
# to consider only items with a minimum percentage 
# of support/ considering a top x of items
# ---
# Displaying top 10 most common items in the transactions dataset 
# and the items whose relative importance is at least 10%
# 
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

# plot the frequency of items
itemFrequencyPlot(df, topN = 10,col="darkgreen")
itemFrequencyPlot(df, support = 0.1,col="darkred")

# we can see that mineral water was most common item
```

```{r}
# Building a model based on association rules 
# using the apriori function 
# ---
# We use Min Support as 0.001 and confidence as 0.8
#this will work as the best parameters sicechanging them will lead to a big rise or drop in rules.
# ---
# 
rules <- apriori (df, parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = 0.8))
rules
```
```{r}
# Observing rules built in our model i.e. first 5 model rules
# ---
# 
inspect(rules[1:5])
# Interpretation of the first rule:
# ---
# If someone buys frozen smoothie, spinach, there is a 88% chance he/she will also buy mineral water
```

```{r}
# Ordering these rules by a criteria such as the level of confidence
# then looking at the first five rules.
# We can also use different criteria such as: (by = "lift" or by = "support")
# 
rules<-sort(rules, by="confidence", decreasing=TRUE)
inspect(rules[1:5])

# Interpretation
# ---
# The given top 4 rules have a confidence of 100
```
