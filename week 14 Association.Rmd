## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(arules)
path_trans<-"http://bit.ly/SupermarketDatasetII"
df<-read.transactions(path_trans,sep=',')
df
```

```{r}
# Verifying the object's class
# ---
# This should show us transactions as the type of data that we will need
# ---
# 
class(df)
```

```{r}
# Previewing our first 5 transactions
#
inspect(df[1:5])
```

```{r}
summary(df)
```

```{r}
itemFrequencyPlot(df, topN=10,  cex.names=1)
```


```{r}
# This would give us some information such as the most purchased items, 
# distribution of the item sets (no. of items purchased in each transaction), etc.
# ---
# 
summary(df)
```
```{r}
# Exploring the frequency of some articles 
# i.e. transacations ranging from 1 to 10 and performing 
# some operation in percentage terms of the total transactions 
itemFrequency(df[, 1:10],type = "absolute")
round(itemFrequency(df[, 1:10],type = "relative")*100,2)
```

```{r}
# Producing a chart of frequencies and fitering 
# to consider only items with a minimum percentage 
# of support/ considering a top x of items
# ---
# Displaying top 10 most common items in the transactions dataset 
# and the items whose relative importance is at least 10%
# 
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

# plot the frequency of items
itemFrequencyPlot(df, topN = 10,col="darkgreen")
itemFrequencyPlot(df, support = 0.1,col="darkred")

# we can see that mineral water was most common item
```

```{r}
# Building a model based on association rules 
# using the apriori function 
# ---
# We use Min Support as 0.001 and confidence as 0.8
#this will work as the best parameters sicechanging them will lead to a big rise or drop in rules.
# ---
# 
rules <- apriori (df, parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = 0.8))
rules
```
```{r}
# Observing rules built in our model i.e. first 5 model rules
# ---
# 
inspect(rules[1:5])
# Interpretation of the first rule:
# ---
# If someone buys frozen smoothie, spinach, there is a 88% chance he/she will also buy mineral water
```


```{r}
# Ordering these rules by a criteria such as the level of confidence
# then looking at the first five rules.
# We can also use different criteria such as: (by = "lift" or by = "support")
# 
rules<-sort(rules, by="confidence", decreasing=TRUE)
inspect(rules[1:5])

# Interpretation
# ---
# The given top 4 rules have a confidence of 100
```
```{r}
library(arulesViz)
```

```{r}
plot(rules)
```
The plot shows support on the x-axis and confidence on the y-axis. Lift ist shown as a color with different levels ranging from grey to red.

We could also use only “confidence” as a specific measure of interest:


```{r}
plot(rules, measure = "confidence")
```
There is a special value for shading called “order” which produces a two-key plot where the color of the points represents the length (order) of the rule if you select method = "two-key plot. This is basically a scatterplot with shading = "order":

```{r}
plot(rules, method = "two-key plot")
```
# Interactive Scatter plot

```{r}
plot(rules, engine = "plotly")
```

4.8 Graph-based visualization
Graph-based techniques concentrate on the relationship between individual items in the rule set. They represent the rules (or itemsets) as a graph with items as labeled vertices, and rules (or itemsets) represented as vertices connected to items using arrows.

For rules, the LHS items are connected with arrows pointing to the vertex representing the rule and the RHS has an arrow pointing to the item.

Several engines are available. The default engine uses igraph (plot.igraph and tkplot for the interactive visualization). … arguments are passed on to the respective plotting function (use for color, etc.).

The network graph below shows associations between selected items. Larger circles imply higher support, while red circles imply higher lift. Graphs only work well with very few rules, why we only use a subset of 10 rules from our data:

```{r}
subrules <- head(rules, n = 10, by = "confidence")

plot(subrules, method = "graph",  engine = "htmlwidget")

```
#Paralel coordinate plot

```{r}
plot(subrules, method="paracoord")
```
